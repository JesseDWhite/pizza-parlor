## Specs
Describe fullPrice()

Test: it should take in input and spit out a new object called "fullOrder" using the PizzaOrder constructor.
Code: pizzaPrice("Small", "Brooklyn", "Mushrooms", "none")
Expected Output: fullPrice
PizzaOrder¬†{pizzaSize: "small", pizzaStyle: "brooklyn", pizzaToppings: "mushrooms", additionalInstructions: "none"}


Describe pizzaPrice()

Test: it should take in information from fullPrice() and concat all the items within the object."
Code: 
let fullPrice = new PizzaOrder("small", "brooklyn", "mushrooms", "none");

PizzaOrder.prototype.pizzaPrice = function () {
    return this.pizzaSize + this.pizzaStyle + this.pizzaToppings + this.additionalInstructions;
} 
Expected Output: smallbrookylnmushroomsnone

Test: it should return an added value from the selected items instead of concating strings.
Code: fullPrice.pizzaPrice()
Expected Output: 20

Test: it should now take values from user form and add them together.
Code: fullPrice.pizzaPrice("small","brooklyn", "mushrooms")
